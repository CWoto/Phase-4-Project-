# Phase-4-Project-
Introduction
Traffic crashes are a major threat to public safety because they often cause injuries,
deaths, and financial losses.
 Knowing the main reasons for these events, when they happen most often, 
and the groups of people who are most affected can help one to come up with good safety measures. 
This project will take a  look at what causes accidents, how often they happen by month and day, and 
how gender affects accident rates and injuries.
Traffic accidents may arise from a confluence of human error, environmental variables, 
and vehicle-related causes. According to published data, prevalent contributory factors of accidents include:
 Speeding: exceeding the speed limit will  shortens reaction time thus one is more prone to accidents 
Distraction : A driver is likely distratected by use of phone while driving ,altering in car entertainment  can also be a 
Major cause of accident 
Disregards of traffic lights especially at intersections 
Driving under the influence of alcohol
Weather condition ,  rain, snow and fog usually increases the risk of collision 
Wreckless  driving is another cause of accidents 

 I will use the data on kaggel  . https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isadoraamorim/trafficcrasheschicago\

 The main objective of this study is to understand the pattern of these accidents .i.e when  and how they occur .
The finding for this projects can be used by other scholars  to deepen their understanding in data analysis
